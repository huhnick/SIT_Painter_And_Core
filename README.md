- Inside of the .zip there's 2 files, place them in the following locations
- ```SIT-Game\BepInEx\plugins replace the StayInTarkov.dll```
- ```SIT-Game\EscapeFromTarkov_Data\Managed replace the Assembly-CSharp.dll```

This has to be done by all clients as well
this is the most recent build with a bunch of fixes like the animations after door unlock and a bunch of other good stuff like, car extracts and others
make sure you have done this too
